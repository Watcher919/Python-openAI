# OpenAI Python Library

The OpenAI Python library provides convenient access to the OpenAI API
from applications written in the Python language. It includes a
pre-defined set of classes for API resources that initialize
themselves dynamically from API responses which makes it compatible
with a wide range of versions of the OpenAI API.

## Documentation

See the [OpenAI API docs](https://beta.openai.com/docs/api-reference?lang=python).

## Installation

You don't need this source code unless you want to modify the package. If you just
want to use the package, just run:

```sh
pip install --upgrade openai
```

Install from source with:

```sh
python setup.py install
```

## Usage

The library needs to be configured with your account's secret key which is available on the [website](https://beta.openai.com/account/api-keys). Either set it as the `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable before using the library:

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY='sk-...'
```

Or set `openai.api_key` to its value:

```python
import openai
openai.api_key = "sk-..."

# list engines
engines = openai.Engine.list()

# print the first engine's id
print(engines.data[0].id)

# create a completion
completion = openai.Completion.create(engine="ada", prompt="Hello world")

# print the completion
print(completion.choices[0].text)
```

### Command-line interface

This library additionally provides an `openai` command-line utility
which makes it easy to interact with the API from your terminal. Run
`openai api -h` for usage.

```
# list engines
openai api engines.list

# create a completion
openai api completions.create -e ada -p "Hello world"
```

## Requirements

-   Python 3.7+

In general we want to support the versions of Python that our
customers are using, so if you run into issues with any version
issues, please let us know at support@openai.com.
